This is a shopify integration with any app.

to run the app first install the npm modules

          npm install
          

and run the app


          npm start
          
          
actually is using the token of my app created in shopify.com that contains 3 products, the purchase is not validate, because I did not associate my credit card to shopify.

I really try hard to understand the integration with ( Shopify + app ) + tuGerente, but I didn't realized how to do that, sorry about it.
